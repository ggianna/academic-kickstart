I am working as an artificial intelligence researcher at the NCSR "Demokritos", [SKEL Lab](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/). I have worked for more than 15 years on domains such as Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Biomedical Informatics. I have also been a reviewer for top conferences in my domain, such as ACL, EACL, NAACL-HLT, EMNLP, SIGDIAL, SLT. I am also contributing as a reviewer for established journals, such as COLING journal, JNLE, KAIS, ACM-SUR and others. I am the organizer of the international community on multi-lingual summarization, [MultiLing](https://multiling.iit.demokritos.gr/). I have been teaching classes since 2013, on topics such as Intelligent Systems, Data Mining, Applied Data Science, Scientific Method. Currently, I am contributing to two MSc programmes, one on Data Science and the other on A.I.

I have been applying research results for more than 8 years, by co-founding and supporting SciFY, a not-for-profit technology transfer company, with more than 100,000 beneficiaries.

I  am a member [EurAI](https://www.eurai.org) and [EACL](https://www.eacl.org). I am a Member of the Board of [EETN, the Hellenic AI Society](https://www.eetn.gr/).
